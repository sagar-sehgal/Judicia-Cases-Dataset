# Judicial Caes Dataset
This Repository contains the dataset(pdf) of all the judgements passed from all high courts of all the districts from the state of  Madhay Pradesh.

The data was scrapped from the https://district.mphc.gov.in/%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6. The complete process to download all the cases PDF was automated using Selenium.

The repository contains the script to automate the task of downloading all the PDFs. Also, I have included some part of the  dataset which I was able to scrap in the PDF forlder.
